Menu-With-CSS
=============

Dropdown menu with CSS

Test was: Create a drop down select list using only CSS3 and Javascript techniques. 
Feel free to use a CSS preprocessor. Do not use jQuery.

I over thought this. I don't know how to create a select list in Javascript so I created a drop down
list and used javascript to get the values off the list and then do something with it. I was not successful. 
There are comments in the js code where I got lost. 

The menus are css. I did not use a preprocessor, but tonight I think I am going to redo that in SASS.
